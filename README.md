=========

## Objectives

- Synchronization must be one-way
- Synchronization should be performed periodically
- File creation/copying/removal operations should be logged
- Folder paths, synchronization interval and log file path should be provided by the user
- It is undesirable to use third-party libraries that implement folder synchronization
- It is allowed to use external libraries implementing other well-known algorightms
